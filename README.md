# Social-Network

This is a home project figuring out how ti create a "social Network". You can type your name and create a post and it will display on the screen. The database would save your input and later display it when you exit the application and run it again.

## Installing/Requirements

First I would recommand creating a new python virtual enviornment.
```
virtualenv --python=python3 env
```

Then i would install the requirement
```
pip install -r requirements.tx
````

Locate the Code folder and run app.py file:
```
python app.py
```

Fianlly open the the local url the application is running by opeing a web browser and just inputing the url.
